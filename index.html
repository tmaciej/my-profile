        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Maciej, a passionate web developer with
          <strong>over 8 years of professional experience</strong> in the IT
          industry and several more as a freelancer. I have extensive commercial
          experience in developing web applications, primarily using
          <strong>React/Next</strong> frameworks and related technologies. I
          also have experience in developing mobile applications using
          <strong>React Native</strong>. I am proficient in creating
          <strong>backend</strong> services and APIs (REST/GraphQL) using
          <strong>Node.js</strong>, although recently, I haven't had many
          opportunities to showcase my skills in that area. I have knowledge of
          CI/CD processes, basic understanding of cloud services like AWS, and a
          background in other technologies such as PHP and AngularJS. I am
          well-versed in object-oriented, functional, and reactive programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          In every project I&apos;ve been a part of, I always strive to use my
          knowledge and experience to assist team members. I work closely with
          product owners to gather requirements and advise on business decisions
          from a technical standpoint. For UI/UX designers, I aim to communicate
          the project&apos;s needs and limitations in the best possible way to
          craft outstanding user experiences. With other developers, I
          collaborate on designing system architecture and interfaces to ensure
          seamless integration and make the development process both efficient
          and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to take on new challenges that will help me grow
          professionally and personally.
